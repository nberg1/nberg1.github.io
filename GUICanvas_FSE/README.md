# Collaborative Canvas Application

**(CS5500, Northeastern University, Fall 2020)**

## Note on project code availability: 

**The instructors for this course have advised students to refrain from sharing their coursework freely as they may decide to reuse this project for future iterations of the course.** Following this, this repository will share the results of the work and a summarization of the project and the development process, but not the project itself. 

## Summary
As part of the coursework for CS5500: Foundations of Software Engineering, my teammates and I applied what we learned about GUI graphics, Agile methodology, various software development life cycles (SDLC), test-driven development, etc. to a final semester project: a collaborative canvas application that multiple users can draw on. The project was written in C++ and made use of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) library and GUI frameworks.
